I am a master's student in Computer Science at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. My interests lie in the fields of theoretical machine learning and optimization. I am also interested in creating new and efficient learning algorithms for large datasets.

Before coming to NYU, I worked as a software engineer at HSBC, Pune. I completed my bachelor's in Computer Engineering from PICT, Pune.
